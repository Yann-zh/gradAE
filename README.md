## GradStop: Exploring Training Dynamics in Unsupervised Outlier Detection through Gradient Cohesion

### Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of GradAE, as described in the paper *"GradStop: Exploring Training Dynamics in Unsupervised Outlier Detection through Gradient Cohesion"*. GradAE is designed to explore the training dynamics within the context of unsupervised outlier detection by leveraging gradient cohesion.

### Requirements
Under the repository directory, install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code
Execute the code by running:
```bash
python run_ae.py
```

### Output
The execution results will be stored in `ae/results` directory.

### Datasets
The datasets used for running this code are sourced from [ADBench](https://github.com/Minqi824/ADBench/tree/main/adbench/datasets/Classical). Data for this project is located in the `data/data_table` path.
